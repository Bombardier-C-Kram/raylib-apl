# raylib-apl
raylib-apl is a library made to write cross-platform graphical applications using the Dyalog APL programming language.

Breaking changes to any feature in raylib-apl should be expected for now, as this library is very young and experimental.

# Warning
Not made as an actual library yet, this repository is considered very experimental currently.

# Getting started
Current examples expect a .dll to be in the raylib-apl directory, downloadable [here](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/tag/5.0). Make sure you download version 5.0.
Then [\]Link](https://dyalog.github.io/link/4.0/API/) to the examples directory and run the examples as functions.

# Parsing (optional)
The autoparsing isn't needed since a fully parsed version is premade, though if you still need to parse, you need to install CBQN to run it till we translate the parser to APL.
